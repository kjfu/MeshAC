## Installation

## Usage

### A/C coupling implemented in Julia

Atomistic-to-continuum coupling method in Julia. The multi-scale model is coupled by BGFC method.

The atomistic model is based on the Julia package JuLIP.

Please do remember to modify the path of mesher3d in AtC constructor (AtC.jl).
